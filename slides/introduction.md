# Who introduced JavaScript?
Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1995 while he was at Netscape Communications Corporation, the creators of the legendary Netscape Navigator web browser. At the time, the Java coding language was rapidly gaining traction and Netscape Communications was working to make it available in Netscape Communicator.

However, Java was too large and too complex to appeal to amateurs, scripters, and designers. In order to solve this problem, Netscape Communications contracted Brendan Eich to design a versatile programming language that could speed up web development and serve as a scripting companion for Java.

# Why was JavaScript created?
Back in 1995, Netscape Communicator (a paid internet browser) was by far the most popular web browser in the world. The founder of Netscape Communications, Marc Andreeseen, wanted to make the web more dynamic by making animations, user interaction, and other types of automation a standard part of any website. 

He also knew that Microsoft was hard at work on their own browser, Internet Explorer, and wanted to make Netscape Communicator more attractive to developers by equipping it with both an enterprise-level coding language (Java) and a smaller scripting language (JavaScript).
